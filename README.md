Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project will demonstate my Javascript abilities.

The player will be prompted with, "Pick Rock, Paper, or Scissors." The player can input their choice in any manner they like i.e. Rock, rock, ROcK, etc. The computer choice will be chosen at random and then compared with the player's choice. A console message will announce whether the player won, tied, or lost. If the player does not enter an answer but proceeds with the prompts then a message of "Please enter a choice!" will be displayed.
