Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This project will demonstate my Javascript abilities.

The player will have the choice of clicking 3 buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). The computer choice will be chosen at random and then compared with the player's choice. A message will announce whether the player won, tied, or lost. The score will be kept and when the player or chatgpt reaches a score of 5 the game will end and a "Play Again?" button will appear to reset the game.
